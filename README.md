The Gowalli CMS
===============

The Gowalli CMS is an open source MIT licensed content management system that makes it easy to edit things on the page and exactly as your users will see it. It uses PHP on the back-end and Mustache/Handlebars tags to create themes.

This software is pre-release and more of a proof-of-concept.  It is highly subject to change.

More information to follow soon.
